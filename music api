"longDescription":"Professional space scientists by day, amateur astronomers by night, three friends park their car on a lone hilltop for another night of stargazing. While scanning the airwaves they uncover a coded message hiding in the static - what they believe is an alien signal. Unable to authenticate their discovery with other astronomers, the friends realize they are the sole witness to mankind's greatest discovery. With their limited gear and sheer willpower, they now race to record, prove and share their breakthrough before it is lost, but the truth they uncover will change our world forever. Inspired by 80s and 90s era adventure and set over the course of one night, Cosmos is a contemporary sci-fi movie exploring the thrilling first hours of first contact - offering spectacle and thrills through the eyes of three ordinary men who learn as much about each other as they do about our place in the Universe."},

"longDescription":"When they ran to save their lives for the first time, they were mere 12-year-old boys, and the world called them 'refugees'. The war of 1971 gave birth to a new country - Bangladesh. It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram and Bala. They witnessed the war and its aftermath, where the world tried to trample over them. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta. Before they knew the world, they knew each other. Such was their bond, such was their friendship. Each time they sought new beginnings, each time they would rise, the world would crush them down. So, they fought again... and again. Together they were unbeatable, unstoppable and inseparable. In the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY! They had everything, but one fine day, Nandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colorful, and they fell head over heels in love with her. But that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm. ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw, arrives as a counter force for Bikram and Bala. What follows is the most sensational story ever told."},
